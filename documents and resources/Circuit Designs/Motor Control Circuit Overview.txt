The Motor Control Circuit will take PWM and Digital signals from the Arduino
and manipulate them to control H-Bridge Drivers for the motors.

Specifications:
	v1:
	- Each pair of motors uses one H-Bridge chip
	- Each H-Bridge Chip is controlled by:
		- 2 semi-synchronized PWM signals
		- 1 Digital signal
	- Passes Servo PWM signals directly from Aruino to Server leads
	- Seperate power supply leads for Motors, Logic & Servos
	- Fuses across +Voltage Power leads

	v2:
	- Each H-bridge chip is controlled by:
		- 1 PWM speed signal
		- 2 digital signals to indicate motor state (fwd,rev,brk,cst)
	- Completely seperate from servos
	- Seperate power supply leads for motors
	- Logic power is supplied by Arduino
	- Fuses across all motor leads
	- Small ceramic capacitors across all motor leads
	- Small ceramic capacitor in parallel with motors
	- Electrolytic capacitors
	
	v3:
	- Drives stepper motors instead of Brushed DC
	- Consists of two components:
		- Translation, Step Counter and Step Indication Signals (SIS)
			- Each stepper is controlled by a digital signal and a pulse from Arduino
			- Each pulse indicates a step in the direction indicated by the digital signal
			- Uses an MSP430 device to set the SIS based on step increments/decrements
				- Wakes up every pulse, reads the direction signal,
				  and changes step phase accordingly
			- SIS is sent to H-Bridge Stepper Driver
			- Routes the Error signals from H-Bridge Stepper Driver back to Arduino
		- H-Bridge Stepper Driver
			- Uses two full bridge chips to drive motor phases
			- H-Bridge chips put out a regulated current for the phases and
			  send fault reports to Arduino
			- Connects directly to power supply
			
	v5:
	- Reverting back to v2. All attributes of that version apply here.
	- A more robust H-Bridge
	- Proper back-emf protection
	- Attempt to implement regenerative braking
