The Motor Control Circuit will take PWM and Digital signals from the Arduino
and manipulate them to control H-Bridge Drivers for the motors.

Specifications:
	v1:
	- Each pair of motors uses one H-Bridge chip
	- Each H-Bridge Chip is controlled by:
		- 2 semi-synchronized PWM signals
		- 1 Digital signal
	- Passes Servo PWM signals directly from Aruino to Server leads
	- Seperate power supply leads for Motors, Logic & Servos
	- Fuses across +Voltage Power leads

	v2:
	- Each H-bridge chip is controlled by:
		- 1 PWM speed signal
		- 2 digital signals to indicate motor state (fwd,rev,brk,cst)
	- Completely seperate from servos
	- Seperate power supply leads for motors
	- Logic power is supplied by Arduino
	- Fuses across all motor leads
	- Small ceramic capacitors across all motor leads
	- Small ceramic capacitor in parallel with motors
	- Electrolytic capacitors
