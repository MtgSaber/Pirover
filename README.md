# Pirover
All files associated with my Pirover project.

Pirover is a wifi-controlled rover with a camera arm.
This is an almost-completely DIY personal project.
It's really just for the learning experience, and because I personally think that it's pretty cool.

All circuitry is driven by an Arduino, which is controlled by a Raspberry Pi A+ via USB.
All control software on the Raspberry Pi will be written in Java.
This is a very long-term project, and I'm mostly learning as I progress.
My end goal is to have a clean, finished product. My objectives are:
 - Custom 3D-printed chassis from my own CAD designs
 - Custom PCB for all circuitry
 - Personal Linux server for video feed buffering and streaming, and sending inputs from the control device to the robot
 - Semi-custom wifi-enabled control device (maybe a phone or Microcontroller attached to a game controller and LCD screen?)

The only skills and experience that I have going into this are:
 - some Autodesk Inventor experience
 - 8 credit-hours of programming classes in Java
 - some Batch and SH scripting experience
 - basic Linux experience, including server maintenance
 - minimal knowledge of circuitry
 - high-school-level physics
 - calculus I and some calculus II
 - learning / adapting concepts and logic very quickly.
